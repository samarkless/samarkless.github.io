<h1>Being the Teacher!</h1>
    <h3>Lets create a program using ruby classes!</h3>
    <p>Hi students! today we will be going over the creation of a program using ruby classes!</p>
    <p>Ruby, in all of its greatness, can allow you to create any kind of object you want! In our example today we will be
        creating a class called "Computer", which will generate instances of that class
        which can then act to manipulate its own imaginary files.</p>

    <p> Firstly, we should create a class called "Computer", and give it an initialize method that takes no parameters. The
        body of initialize itself, should be empty. It should look something like this:</p>
    <p>  class Computer <br>
             def initialize<br>
             end<br>
         end
   </p> 
   
   <p>Next, we should be passing our initialize method some parameters and setting up a few instance variables.
   Here we update our initialize method to take 2 parameters, username and password. In initialize, set the instance variables to @username and @password.In our initialize method we also want to add another instance variable, @files, which is equal to an empty hash. This will act to 
   keep track of our files later on. The code should look like this:
   </p>
   
   <p>  class Computer <br>
            def initialize (username, password) <br>
                @username = username <br>
                @password = password<br>
                @files = {}<br>
    end<br>
end
   </p> 
   
   <p>Now, let's introduce some class variables into the mix! We will be using @@users to keep track of the users on our computer.
   Add a new class variable to our computer class called @@users, it should equal an empty hash.
   Next, in the initialize method, set @@users[username] equal to password, so that our @@users hash keeps usernames as keys with each username's password
   as the associated value. Your code should look like this:
    </p>
    <p>
       class Computer<br>  
    @@users = {}<br>
    def initialize (username, password)<br>
        @username = username<br>
        @password = password<br>
        @files = {}<br>
        @@users[username] = password<br>
    end<br>
end
    </p>
    <p> Now let's add another method, create. Inside our Computer class, define a method called create, with a single
    parameter, filename. Inside create, declare a variable called time and set it equal to the current time, this is done by using Time.now.
    Inside create, add a new key:value pair to @files hash. Use the filename key to store the value time. Finally, use puts to return a message telling the user
    that a new file was created. Your code should look something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        class Computer  <br>
    @@users = {}<br>
    def initialize (username, password)<br>
        @username = username<br>
        @password = password<br>
        @files = {}<br>
        @@users[username] = password<br>
    end<br>
    
    def create (filename)<br>
        time = Time.now<br>
        @files[filename] = time <br>
        puts "#{filename} was created by #{@username} at #{time}"<br>
    end<br>
end
    </p>
    
    <p>Almost done guys! We need to now find a way to get to our @@users class variable! We will need to create a method to reach it. 
    because @@users is a class variable, we can use a class method to get it. Most of the methods used to far have been instance variables, which work on specific instances/objects. A class method
    belongs to the class itself. Add a new class method to your Computer class called Computer.get_users, taking no parameters. This new method should return the @@users class variable and puts a message!.
    Your code should look like this:</p>
        
    <p>class Computer <br>  
    @@users = {}<br> 
    def initialize (username, password)<br> 
        @username = username<br> 
        @password = password<br> 
        @files = {}<br> 
        @@users[username] = password<br> 
    end<br> 
    
    def create (filename)<br> 
        time = Time.now<br> 
        @files[filename] = time <br> 
        puts "new file has been created!"<br> 
    end<br> 
    
    def Computer.get_users<br> 
        @@users<br> 
        puts "Let's get those users for you!"<br> 
    end<br> 
end
</p>
    
    <p> Last part! Were going to create an instance of our Computer class, this will help us test our code! After your
    class, create a new instance of Computer, store it in a variable called my_computer. You can input any username and password you like for your
    arguments! You can also ask the Computer to create a new text document! Your code should look something like this:
    </p>
    
    <p> class Computer  <br>
    @@users = {}<br>
    def initialize (username, password)<br>
        @username = username<br>
        @password = password<br>
        @files = {}<br>
        @@users[username] = password<br>
    end<br>
    
    def create (filename)<br>
        time = Time.now<br>
        @files[filename] = time <br>
        puts "new file has been created!"<br>
    end<br>
    
    def Computer.get_users<br>
        @@users<br>
    end<br>
end<br>

my_computer = Computer.new("username", "password")
my_computer.create("classproject.txt")<br>
puts "users: #{Computer.get_users}"
