    <h1>Dealing with Conflict</h1>
    
        <h2>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</h2>
            <p>This experience was actually quite recent. I had been working at a part-time job for about two months and I was terminated earlier than we had previously agreed upon. The problem was that we had a verbal agreement as to when I would eventually leave the company rather than having a concrete contract. I was thus relying on the good faith of my employer to keep up his end of the bargain.  </p>
        <h2>What was the source of the conflict?</h2>
            <p>See above.</p>
        
        <h2>How did you handle that conflict?</h2>
            <p>While my initial inner reaction was one of disappointment and anger, I realised that approaching my employer with such a mindset would be useless. I thus calmed myself down and attempted to have a constructive conversation with him about what had happened.</p>
        
        <h2>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</h2>
            <p>My approach did open a fruitful conversation between myself and my employer in terms of clarifying what each of us believed was fair with regards to the situation at hand, however this didn't change the eventual outcome of me leaving early.</p>
        
        <h2>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h2> 
        <p>Not much, I think given the circumstances I acted accordingly and didn't let my emotions get the best of me.</p>
        
        <h2>What did you learn from this experience?</h2> 
        <p>Have a stone cold contract and not rely on the words of potentially shady characters.</p>
