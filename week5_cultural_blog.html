    <h1>Problems facing Technology</h1>
        <p>I was combing over the internet looking for some sort of insightful take on one of the more prevalent technological problems of our time and found an excellent article
            from the Wall Street Journal that outlines what I personally believe to be a few intrinsic problems in the relationship between man and technology. One of the first problems I'd like to outline is probably one of the most basic ones too, simply put, the technology we produce does not always work out the way we wanted it to. 
            As time has gone by, and technology has progressed, we have become increasingly dependent on it to meet all of our expectations and handle any kind of traffic we may throw at it. We also sometimes do this without making sure we have adequate failsafes and backups in store for our own security and piece of mind. The reason why this is a problem now is 
            simply because technology permeates every part of our lives, as opposed to, for example, 50 years ago. Now, if our technology doesn't work, transportation shuts down, we cannot work on our all important assignments, and we cannot communicate properly. Of course, this may be a tad bit over dramaticising. however the argument remains the same regardless of how important the consequences may be.
            We need to make sure that our pursuit of attaining new levels of technology is always accompanied by a mind and populous that is willing to use it sagaciously. This can include the use of back ups and failsafes even in our everyday lives, in order to mitigate the potential risks associated to technology usage.

       <p> Another popular subject these days concerning technology revolves around cybersecurity. Similar to the notion above, we are clearly more reliant on technology, sharing our most personal details with millions of users worldwide, and this data must be protected
       from any potential hackers, thieves, or dangerous individuals. Not only is this a problem, but companies that deal with technology must now strike balance between user vulnerability and maintaining a modest level of business flexibility. In terms of answers to this, there are no steadfast rules on what one can do, although a viable path sees us striking appropriate balances between making the user's life as positive and convenient as possible, and keeping the user safe.
