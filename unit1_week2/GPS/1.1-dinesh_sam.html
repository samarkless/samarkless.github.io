    <h4>Thoughts Discussion on pairing</h4>
        <p>Pair-programming is the act of teaming up with another fellow programmer in order to complete a specific task. I believe it is important to DBC because it really emphasises the importance of cooperating with the people working around you and being able to communicate effectively. While pairing one programmer is the driver and the other is the navigator. The navigator essentially gives instructions and methods of writing code to the driver, who in turn, writes the code down. I feel for me that navigation was a bit more difficult as there is the pressure of making sure everything you communicate to the driver in terms of syntax should be correct otherwise you are giving faulty instructions. That being said I greatly enjoyed both roles.</p>
    <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>I had a great time pairing for the first time. One thing that was crucial and that worked was communicating effectively. We ran into a couple of syntax problems however with clear communication and a bit of internet searching we were able to overcome this.</p>
