    <h1>Pairing & Feedback</h1>
    
        <h2>What was it like to pair with outhers to solve challenges?</h2>
            <p>It has definitely been a rewarding experience so far! It helps you communicate your ideas out loud to another person while working through the problem in a calm and step-by-step manner. It makes sure you are clear with your ideas and it encourages you to ask questions when you are stuck.</p>
  
        <h2>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</h2>
            <p>During my GPS this week, we ran into a couple of problems while debugging our code. The important thing here is that we voiced the specific problems and then went through tutorials or searched for examples in order to help us through each problem area.</p>
        <h2>Was something frustrating and difficult</h2>
            <p>Nothing has been frustrating. Perhaps a difficulty I have is to make sure that when I'm searching through a website or looking through ways to improve our code, that I clearly state my thought process out loud</p>
        <h2>Was the feedback you receieved helpful to your learning?</h2>
            <p>I feel as though the feedback I have received so far on my guided pairing sessions has been extremely helpful and has already made me better in pairing sessions.</p>
        <h2>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</h2> 
        <p>I'm going to articulate my thought process very clearly to my teammate and also make sure that we debug our code as often as possible.</p>
        <h2>How was it to write feedback?</h2> It was gratifying in the way that I enjoy encouraging people with their work, it is also helpful for the person receiving the feedback to make them better coders.
        <h2>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</h2> 
        <p>Nothing at this moment.</p>
        <h2>Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?</h2> 
        <p>It is quite invaluable in terms of becoming a better coder.</p>
