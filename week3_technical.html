<h1>Arrays vs. Hashes</h1>
    <h5>The programming language Ruby has indexed collections of data which are called arrays and hashes. Both of these indexed collections are capable of storing objects which are accessed using a key. </h5>
    <h3><em>Arrays</em></h3>
        <p>Arrays are essentially collections of objects which are ordered by an integer index  </p>
            <p>Example: ary = [1, "two", 3.0] #=> [1, "two", 3.0] </p>
    
    <h3><em>Hashes</em></h3>
        <p>A hash in Ruby is like a dictionary of unique keys and their linked values. It is a collection of objects that are indexed by key:value pairs.</p>
            <p>Example: grades = { "Jane Doe" => 10, "Jim Doe" => 6 }</p>
    
    <h2>Which one is better? When should we use each?</h2>
        <p>In simplistic terms, we can say that it is easier and more efficient to access array elements, however hashes provide a lot more flexibility. If you simply want a collection of values that you can iterate over easily, go with arrays. If you want unique keys which are linked to unique values, then you should go with Hashes and its key-value indexing. </p>
