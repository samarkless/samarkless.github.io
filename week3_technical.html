	    <h1> Question of the day!</h1>
	        <h2>Why is <em>JavaScript</em> so popular in web development?</h2>
		        <p><em>In the past it has sometimes been said that Javascript was a clumsy language associated with the more annoying aspects of the user experience on the internet, such as popups. However this has now changes quite dramatically. Javascript has witnessed a resurgence and is very popular for web developers. But why is this? There are many reasons one could regurgitate, however what follows is the few that I believe are quite important.
		            First of all, javascript is relatively easy to learn. The nature of the language is flexible and standardized across multiple browser platforms. 
		            Javascript is also easy to edit for web developers. Using javascript, the code you write doesn't need to compiled and so using a compiler or other potentially expensive software is not necessary.
		            There are also a lot of available tools that web developers can use when it comes to javascript, thus giving the ability to users to look behind a website's veil and analyse the javascript that is running behind the website.
		            These tools also make it expceptionally easy for javascript to be debugged if you run into errors. While javascript may be easy to learn,
		            it can be made to carry out extremely complex tasks behind the scenes, and as such it can potentially require a lot of code and time to develop.
		            In order to make this process more amicable, developers have written libraries to support the language, perhaps the most noteworth of these being jQuery.</em></p>
