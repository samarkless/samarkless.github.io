<h1>Enumerable#map</h1>
    <h3> What does this method do?</h3>
      <p>  <em>What are enumberables?</em> Basically these are a set of methods which traverse, search, sort and manipulate the user's input. <em>What is the Map Method?</em> The Map method basically loops through what the user has inputed, say an array, and then preforms a function on the elements of said array.</p>
      Consider the example below taken from ruby.bastardsbook.com:
      
                              <p><strong>arr = [1,2,3,4,5]</p>
                                      <p>brr = arr.map{|x| -x} </p>

                                      <p>puts arr.join(", ")   #=>   1, 2, 3, 4, 5</p>   
                                      <p>puts brr.join(", ") #=> -1, -2, -3, -4, -5</strong></p>
       
      <p>In the example above, the map method returns a copied version of the elements that it is called upon, the map method takes an enumerable object and a block, and runs the block for each element, it then gives an output which is each returned value from the block.</p>
