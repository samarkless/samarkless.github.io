	<h1> nba.com </h1>
		<p> This website for me is absolutely excellent. It is one of my favorite because I love basketball, but it goes further than that. Once you hit the homepage your eyes are immediately drawn to the large amount of images which create a great visual appeal. NBA lovers go to this website to get the latest news and highlights and they are immediately introduced to this the second they get on the page. The website is stuffed with fun content, however it can also be quite cluttered with the numerous redirects and tabs. That being said it is quite easy to find what you are looking for on the website due to the clear headings.</p>

	<h2> bleacherreport.com </h2>

		<p> A similar type of website to the one above, this website provides you with the latest news and results from a plethora of different sports. What attracts me to this website is again, the large amount of visually pleasing content. This website however also has the added function of being able to create content which you can post about a certain sport or team, and then you can have discussions over the content with other fans below. I find this highly appealing for sports lovers like me as I can get lost in debates with people. At the same time this also present a significant time wastage if I'm busy or have other things to do.</p>

	<h3> gamefaqs.com</h3>

		<p> This website is a social forum for the video gaming industry. It contains numerous databases of information about any type of gaming technology and software. Users create threads and posts discussing technology or video games. At first glance, one can see that it is definitely not as visually appealing as the two websites above, it lacks visual appeal on the homepage which may not catch the eye of a passerby visiting the website. However, if one ventures into one of the headings or tabs, they will be pleasantly suprised by the sheer amount of richly detailed guides and databases, fulfilling any need that a person may have when visiting the website. </p>
