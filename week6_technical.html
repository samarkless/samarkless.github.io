    <h3>What is Functional Programming? and how does it differ from Object-Oriented Programming?</h3>

    <p>Hi students! today we will be going over what Functional Programmming is, and how it may differ from OOP. First of all, what is functional programming? A quick generic definition is as follows, functional programming is a concept which treats computation as an evaluation of mathematical functions, while doing this, it essentially avoids state and mutable data. Thus, we can say that functional 
    programming attempts to create a code which has no side effects and no changes in the value of variables you may write. Functional
    programming is thus considered to be the antithesis of imperative programming, which emphasises changing of state. Ruby is widely considered
    to be an object oriented language at heart, meaning that any and every value appears to Ruby as an object, and everything we type in Ruby is an object. That being said, functional style code can be written in Ruby, allowing us to create a cleaner code where the variables we use 
    are not modified once defined, so that we do not follow the change of state. This is one of the main differences between OOP and functional
    programming, OOP tends to emphasize the change of state in objects. In functional programming we do not attempt to update variables in our code, we just create new ones, unlike in OOP. Consider the following example, which illustrates the difference between functional programming and OOP : </p>

    <p> In OOP we may update an array by doing the following: </p>
      <p>   indexes = [1, 2, 3] <br>
            indexes << 4 <br>
            indexes # [1, 2, 3, 4] <br>
      </p>

    <p> Using functional programming, instead of updating our array, we simply create a new element: </p>

       <p>   indexes = [1, 2, 3] <br>
             all_indexes = indexes + [4] # [1, 2, 3, 4]<br>
        </p>

    <p> The two examples above show one of the most important differences between OOP and functional programming! I hope 
        you guys and girls managed to learn something out of it ! </p>
