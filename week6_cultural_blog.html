    <h1>Stereotype Threat!</h1>
        
       <p>  What is Stereotype Threat ? The experience known as stereotype threat is where a person in a specific situation, has the potential 
        to confirm a negatively based stereotype about themselves or their social group. Stereotype threat is one of the most widely studied topics in the field of social psychology, due to the fact that the phenomena has been shown to, at times, drastically reduce the performance of individuals in any arena, who belong to negatively stereotyped groups. One of the major causes of bad performance is that 
        when under the veil of stereotype threat, group members are likely to become ancious about their performance, which hinders their true ability, or their ability to perform at the maximum level. On a more personal level, without going into too much detail, I've felt stereotype threat before in terms of sports and physical strength and stamina. The problem is that sometimes people categorize you, without understanding that all people are equal in a given activity. When I felt the stereotype threat it was almost like a self fulfilling prophecy. Because I knew that people viewed me in that way, I started to believe that what they thought was right or the truth. Because of this, my actual performance was drastically lowered in terms of quality, simply because I started to feel and believe what other people thought was true. This was startling for me because something that was completely mentally based was affecting something
        predominantely physical. It took me awhile to get over these stereotypes, but it was mainly pushed forward by the fact that firstly, everything I was feeling and subsequently doing was all under my control. I let the stereotype affect me, and I could choose to move past it. If I was working with anyone who I felt was being affected by stereotype threat, I would immediately address the problem at hand. I've experienced what it feels like to go through it and I'd never want anyone to go through that, not only in terms of the person'#s individual happiness, but simply because the stereotype threat will possibly make them underachieve when they can do and be so much more. When I'm working in a team I will stress that everyone, and everyone's work, is all equal. Nobody is more important than anyone else, or better than anyone else at any given task or feat. I'll make sure to keep the channels of communication open at all times by outlining that in a personal capacity I'm part of the team to help anyone with any problem, whether it be technical or emotional. I think it is pivotal to create a work and living environment where people believe and know that they can rely on each other.
